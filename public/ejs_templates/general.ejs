          <li>Javascript Battle is a fun and engaging web application intended to make artificial intelligence (AI) design accessible to all.</li>
          <li>Every day, your code will be pulled down from your "hero-starter" repository on Github.  To get started on Github, check out the step-by-step instructions in the Login section.</li>
          <li>Your code (along with every other user's code) will be run daily, behind the scenes, in our game engine.</li>
          <li>You can watch one of yesterday's battles below.  Don't see your hero?  After you've been signed up for at least one day, you can login to see your hero's battle in particular.</li>
          <li>You can login to check out your hero's personal stats, or check out the leaderboard to see how you rank up against the competition.</li>
          <li>If your hero isn't performing well, simply crack open your hero code on Github, make some changes, and we'll use your new code for the next day's battle!</li>
          <li>You can test out your hero code locally on your computer (instructions in the hero-starter repo), OR you can watch your hero fight a "test battle" at our new <a target="_blank" href="http://codetester.javascriptbattle.com">JS Battle Code Tester Site!</a></li>
          <li>Such is the power of Javascript!</li>
