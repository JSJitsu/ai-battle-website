          <li>Each day you will be assigned to a team at random and will fight for that king.</li>
          <li>Teams can win by either 1) Killing every member of the opposing team, or 2) being in possession of more diamonds than the opposing team after 1250 turns.</li>
          <li>Your hero's code will decide which way to travel depending on the state of the game.  There are only 5 choices: "North", "South", "East", "West", and "Stay."</li>
          <li>Every hero starts with the full 100 health points. If your hero's health drops below 0, he or she dies.</li>
          <li>Moving into a diamond mine will capture the mine, but BEWARE...All diamond mines are magic, and will deal 20 damage points to the new owner any time they are captured.</li>
          <li>Your hero will earn 1 diamond for each mine he/she owns at the start of his/her turn.</li>
          <li>Moving into a "Health Well" tile will heal your hero by 30 hp.</li>
          <li>Moving into a friendly hero will heal that hero for 40 health. Remember, there is no "i" in team.</li>
          <li>Enemies are attacked automatically at the <em>end</em> of your hero's turn. At the end of your turn, your hero will hit all adjacent enemies for 20 damage points each.</li>
          <li>You can also attack by moving into an enemy.  This will deal 10 damage (in addition to the 20 damage described above, for up to 30 damage total)</li>
